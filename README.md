# Docker Fake SQS

 * Source: https://github.com/bbc-news/docker-fake-sqs
 * Website: https://github.com/bbc-news/docker-fake-sqs

This creates a [Docker](http://docker.io) container for running the [fake-sqs](https://github.com/iain/fake_sqs) gem.


## Installation

Clone this repo and run: `docker build -t <yourname>/fake-sqs .`, this should build
the required container for running a fake sqs endpoint within Docker.


## Usage

The easiest way to use this container is to use the public image from the docker index:

`docker run -d -p 4568:4568 bbcnews/fake-sqs`

This is will damonize the container than expose the endpoint to your local machine (Or VM if you're running on OSX).

### Database location

By default the database file is stored in `/var/data/fake_sqs`, if you'd like to get hold of this just mount it when you run the container:


`docker run -d -p 4568:4568 -v /host/dir:/var/data/fake_sqs bbcnews/fake-sqs`



If you've built the image locally then you can run the resulting image fairly easily with: `docker run -t -i <yourname>/fake-sqs`
